1. v1: Bfs:
    - running from source -> target: 1-direction

2. v2: Bidirectional bfs: 
    - 2 threads: s->t and t->s
    - stop if met the other side

3. v3: Optimized threaded BFS
    - create ThreadPoolExecutor, reusing this throughout BFS
    - threads only handle Wiki page fetching
    - SpaCy run sequentially
    - Aggressive caching: prevents repeats
    - currently fastest
